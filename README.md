A mouse macro for the game Evony: The Kings Return.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** Java

This application was built for my father. The game, Evony: The King's Return is a mobile base-building game where, in short, there is a large map. Simply swiping around the map collects valuable resources, but that can lead to [repetitive motion injuries](https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/the-health-effects-of-too-much-gaming-2020122221645). So I developed this macro to combat that hazard, while still being able to collect the valuable resources.

## How to Use:

- First you need to specify the coordinates for where you want the macro to *start* to drag *horizontally* by clicking the `Find Starting Position` button and clicking anywhere **outside** of the application.
- Next you need to specify the coordinates for where you want the macro to *stop* dragging by clicking the `Find End Position` button and clicking anywhere **outside** of the application.
- You can check the `Repeat Infinitely` checkbox to have the macro repeat until manually stopping.
- In the `Horizontal Swipe Count` textbox, specify the number of times you want the macro to swipe horizontally before performing another swipe vertically.
- In the `Vertical Swipe Count` textbox, specify the number of times you want the macro to swipe vertically. This value is used to determine how when the macro will end.
> This is dependent on whether or not the `Repeat Infinitely` checkbox is ticked.
- After you have all the points specified, click the `Start Mouse Macro` button

- Pressing any key on the keyboard will stop the macro in-progress, though will not be immediate.
- Pressing the `q` key on the keyboard will quit the application entirely, immediately.
